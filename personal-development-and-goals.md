# Personal Development & Goals

In Progress - 2022

- ðŸ“– Learn Storybook; I am now actively using Storybook to help implement a Design System and Component Library.

- ~~Complete [Laravel 8 From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch)
I have started working through the Laravel course.~~
I have decided to simply build a Laravel application instead as a learning process.

- ðŸ“– Complete [Rust 'The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - I have started working
through the documentation, and have created a basic CLI application that clones frequently used repositories.

Completed Goals & Achievements - 2022

- âœ… Complete [Go Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) - I have learnt the basics of Go.

- âœ… Complete - Full Stack Application with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I developed a basic Reddit / Hackernews clone using the above stack. The project will be in a
    continuous state of development.

- âœ… Complete - Build A [Demo Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo)

    During the beginning of March, I investigated how to create a
    custom [Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), which
    would later lead me to build out components for Tillos landing
    application page.

- âœ… Complete - Build Components Using TDD

    During March-April 2022, I completed several new components for Tillo, 
    all developed using Test Driven Development (TDD), with documentation for each component, 
    which should lay a foundation for a future internal component library. 
    These components will first be used for Tillo's landing application page. These components have now also been used internally for part of another project.

    Our future component library will instead be built from the ground up with Storybook (see above goal and progress).

- âœ… Complete - Learn [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I have learnt the basics of using Mock Service Worker, and
    have implemented it into my [Hackernews Clone](https://github.com/CRBroughton/hackernews-clone). I have used the knowledge to help convert old AJAX responses at work to use Mock Service Worker instead.
