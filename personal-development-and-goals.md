# Personal Development & Goals

In Progress - 2022

- 📖 Complete [Laravel 8 From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch)
I have started working through the Laravel course.

- 📖 Complete [Rust 'The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - I have started working
through the documentation, and have created a basic CLI application that clones frequently used repositories.

Completed Goals & Achievements - 2022

- ✅ Complete [Go Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) - I have learnt the basics of Go.

- ✅ Complete - Full Stack Application with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I developed a basic Reddit / Hackernews clone using the above stack. The project will be in a
    continuous state of development.

- ✅ Complete - Build A [Demo Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo)

    During the beginning of March, I investigated how to create a
    custom [Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), which
    would later lead me to build out components for Tillos landing
    application page.

- ✅ Complete - Build Components Using TDD

    During March-April 2022, I completed several new components for Tillo, 
    all developed using Test Driven Development (TDD), with documentation for each component, 
    which should lay a foundation for a future internal component library. 
    These components will first be used for Tillo's landing application page.

- ✅ Complete - Learn [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I have learnt the basics of using Mock Service Worker, and
    have implemented it into my [Hackernews Clone](https://github.com/CRBroughton/hackernews-clone).
