# Personal Development & Goals

- ðŸ“– In Progress - Building Sibyl, a type-safe query builder,
written in TypeScript.
- ðŸ“– In Progress - Building Regress, a visual regression testing
application for image repositories.
- ðŸ“– In Progress - Continuing with mentoring across the buisness,
as well as more interactive front-end focused workshops.

Completed Goals & Achievements - 2024

- ðŸ“– Complete - Created a custom TypeScript testing library,
https://github.com/CRBroughton/ts-test-utils that can test Typescript
types.

- ðŸ“– Complete - One of the core contributors to the [International
Payments](https://www.tillo.io/blog/introducing-international-payments-tillos-real-time-fx-tool) feature at Tillo. I built both the user and internal facing UIs using Vue and TypeScrtipt, as well as the back-end page endpoints in Laravel and PHP.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Overhauled the [Tillo API Documentation site](https://tillo.tech) using Vitepress.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Wrote the Nuxt Modular Architecture RFC for Tillo
to re-imagine how front-ends might be developed using Nuxt and Nuxt
Modules.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Conducted interviews for senior and lead technical
positions.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Rewrote and modernised all of Tillo's internal documentation
and onboarding guide for front-end development.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Presented at TilloTech 2024 - A Voyage Through Front End Development. This talk was about design tokens, components and component composition - https://crbroughton.me/talks/voyage/

Completed Goals & Achievements - 2023

- ðŸ“– Complete - I have been promoted from a junior role to Front-end Engineer âœ…
- ðŸ“– Complete - Ran various interactive workshops, focusing on an introduction to front-end deelopment at Tillo.
- ðŸ“– Complete - Mentored various engineers across multiple teams
to level-up their front-end skills, enabling them to become full-stack
contributors to Tillo's codebases. This has enabled other teams to
successfully deliver their OKR's.

- ðŸ“– Complete - Successfully migrated Tillo's existing bundler from Webpack to Vite. This work involved removing existing dependencies and installing new dependencies, whilst ensuring our existing MPA continues to function as expected. This PR was significantly large and required collaboration with senior engineers to ensure this changes were correct and had no negative impacts to our application. As part of this migration, I also successfully fixed a long standing compilation issue we were facing, where every change to the front-end erroneously created newly compiled JavaScript bundles.

- ðŸ“– Complete [V3](https://v3.cbroughton.me) - I have created a meta-framework/template
for Nuxt & Vue, which is inspired by [T3](https://t3.gg). This framework helps to provide a full
end-to-end type-safe experience.

In Progress - 2023

- ðŸ“– Complete - Build real-time notification system with Websockets - To better enable
updates to our end users, I will create a real-time notification system using Websockets.
Initially this implementation will be specific to one domain, however the intention is to
provide site-wide real-time notifications for a variety of reports a given end-user
may wish to recieve and act upon.

- ~~Complete [Laravel 8 From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch)
I have started working through the Laravel course.~~
I have decided to simply build a Laravel application instead as a learning process.
- Create a TUI for the regression testing program, BackstopJS

- ðŸ“– Complete [Rust 'The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - I have started working
through the documentation, and have created a basic CLI application that clones frequently used repositories. I have decided to start this again, however I'm now using the rustlings
repository to guide my progress alongside The Book.

# 2022

Completed Goals & Achievements - 2022

- âœ… Learn Storybook; I am now actively using Storybook to help implement a Design System and Component Library.

- âœ… Complete [Go Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) - I have learnt the basics of Go.

- âœ… Complete - Full Stack Application with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I developed a basic Reddit / Hackernews clone using the above stack. The project will be in a
    continuous state of development.

- âœ… Complete - Build A [Demo Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo)

    During the beginning of March, I investigated how to create a
    custom [Component Library](https://github.com/CRBroughton/component-lib-demo) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), which
    would later lead me to build out components for Tillos landing
    application page.

- âœ… Complete - Build Components Using TDD

    During March-April 2022, I completed several new components for Tillo, 
    all developed using Test Driven Development (TDD), with documentation for each component, 
    which should lay a foundation for a future internal component library. 
    These components will first be used for Tillo's landing application page. These components have now also been used internally for part of another project.

    Our future component library will instead be built from the ground up with Storybook (see above goal and progress).

- âœ… Complete - Learn [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)

    I have learnt the basics of using Mock Service Worker, and
    have implemented it into my [Hackernews Clone](https://github.com/CRBroughton/hackernews-clone). I have used the knowledge to help convert old AJAX responses at work to use Mock Service Worker instead.
